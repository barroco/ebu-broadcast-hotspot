EBU Broadcasting Hotspot
2011, Matthias P. Br√§ndli
=========================

The goal of this project is to create a prototype for a broadcasting hotspot,
which receives DVB, DAB and other signals using one or several USB receivers,
and retransmits them over Ethernet/WiFi to a handheld device (Android/iOS).

Streaming video to android works, using VLC on the hotspot. No control code has been
written for it, because I am still looking for a way to change the DVB programme
remotely for VLC.

Streaming DAB to android works, and the control interface in the hotspot daemon
has been written.


Description of folder contents:

dbus/
 - contains the first implementation of a python control interface to openmokast
   using dbus. It does not support all commands, but serves as an example.

dvbchans.txt
 - list of DVB channels on the swiss channel 34

dvblast.conf ffserver.conf
 - test configurations for dvblast and ffserver, which are of no great use. They're only
   partly correct anyway.

examples-vlc.txt
 - contains different options I tried to get video streaming to work with a DVB dongle and with
   android. The conclusion is the most important part of this document.

gstreamer/
 - experimentation with gstreamer, which is not very practical for the task at hand.

hotspotd/
 - python code for the hotspot daemon, running on the device with the hardware receivers (DAB, DVB, whatever...)

stream.sh
 - script to call VLC for DVB streaming
