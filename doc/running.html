    <div class="chapeau">This page explains how to start the hotspot daemon and how to use it.</div>

    <h2>1: DBUS session</h2>
    <p>Before starting anything, make sure a dbus session is running. If you are using a graphical user interface (e.g. GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc...) you will
    be okay, and you can skip this step.</p>
    <p>If this is not the case (i.e. you are on a linux text console, or using a windowmanager without dbus like fluxbox), you must start dbus manually.
    The easiest way to do this is to launch GNU Screen with its own dbus session. <b>Only programs launched from a Screen window</b> will be able
    to communicate with each other. Therefore, you must launch openmokast and hotspotd <b>in the same Screen</b>.</p>
    <p>To start the dbus session, execute:</p>
    <p><span class="cmd">dbus-launch screen</span></p>
    <p>If you do not know how to use GNU Screen, please read its man-page.</p>

    
    <h2>2: OpenMokast</h2>
    <p>Start openmokast. No specific options are required. You must run OpenMokast before the Hotspot Daemon, because it has to connect to the dbus bus first.</p>
    <p>If you do not want the GUI to show up, call:
    <span class="cmd">openmokast -c [other options]</span></p>

    <p>You can also specify you DAB source:</p>
    <p>Using the Albrecht DR 403 USB receiver: <span class="cmd">openmokast -c -M</span></p>
    <p>Using and ETI file: <span class="cmd">openmokast -c -e &lt;example.eti&gt;</span></p>


    <h2>3: Hotspot Daemon</h2>
    <p>Finally, you have to start the hotspot daemon. You must <span class="cmd">cd</span> to the <span class="cmd">hotspotd</span> folder and call:
    <span class="cmd">./hotspotd.py</span>.
    
    <h2>4: Android application</h2>
    <p>Launch the android application on your device. To make sure that your wifi connection is ok, you can go to the hotspot webpage using
    <span class="cmd">http://&lt;hotspot ip address&gt;:8080</span>. This URL is also the one the application uses, and you can set it by pressing on the
    menu button in the application.</p>
    <p>You can then choose between different technologies (you should see DAB as only entry in the list). Then, a list of programmes is presented. Clicking
    on one of these starts the player after some delay. Also, RadioVIS slides and RadioText are shown on the screen, in addition to the parameters of the 
    chosen programme. A tap on the slide will start a browser to the associated link URL.</p>
