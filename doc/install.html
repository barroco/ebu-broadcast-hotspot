    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p>In addition to those the requirements for OpenMokast, the hotspot requires the following libraries and
    software components to be installed on the machine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>python (version 2.6) with the following modules:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>avahi</li>
            <li>dbus</li>
        </ul>
        <li>VLC with a complete libavcodec. In some distributions (notably Debian and Ubuntu), the libavcodec does not include an MP3 encoder. It is therefore
        required to install the library from a third party repository. For Debian, you can use <a href="http://debian-multimedia.org/">debian-multimedia</a>.
        For Ubuntu, use package <span class="cmd">libavcodec-extra-52</span> from <a href="http://medibuntu.org">medibuntu</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the development machine, you will at least need the <span class="cmd">adb</span> tool from the android SDK if you want to program you android phone.
    It can be useful to install the whole SDK including Eclipse if you intend to modify the application. More details are available
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk">on the android website</a>. The application has been written for Android 2.2, and is known to work on android 2.3 phones
    as well. You can, in addition to 2.2, also choose your version according to your device.

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>First, install the required dependencies and compile and install OpenMokast according to its own documentation. You need to take the latest SVN version
    on the sourceforge <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmokast/">project page</a> which includes some modifications for the dbus interface.</p>

    <p>Install the aforementioned dependencies and libraries.</p>

    <p>Make sure that VLC works, especially transcoding, by executing the following command:<br />
    <span class="cmd">cvlc -v audio --sout "#transcode{vcodec=none,acodec=mp3,ab=320,channels=2,samplerate=48000}:http{dst=:8080/audio.mp3}"</span>
    where <span class="cmd">audio</span> is some audio file.

    <p>The Hotspot Daemon does not need any compilation or preparation. If you want to put it somewhere else, take care to copy all files to the same place.</p>
